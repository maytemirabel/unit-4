## Criteria A: Planning
### Problem Definition:
Often times, students are ISAK are not satisfied with the limited dessert options provided by CK. The same chocolate chip cookies, sunflower cake and jelly get incredibly repetitive so those students with a sweet tooth make their own desserts. Some students, in order to spread their creations, have shared their recipes in class group chats so others can learn from them but they are often forgotten and even worse, neglected. Bakers at ISAK are in immediate need of a social network which will allow them to share recipes and connect with each other and their cultures. 

 
### Success Criteria:
1.
